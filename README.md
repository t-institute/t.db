## The Problem

[Testosterone levels have declined 30% in the last 40 years](https://www.tparty.org/p/announcing-t-party). As an aside, sperm count levels have declined 60% in the last 40 years, and women are also going through puberty 2 years earlier than 40 years before, perhaps for similar reasons. There is no consensus reason why this is, but factors could be lifestyle as well as [environmental toxins](https://twitter.com/inflammateomnia/status/1685864874155429888).

One systematic issue with the American healthcare system is that there is one monolithic range for "healthy" testosterone levels, typically said to be around 300-1000 ng/dL of total testosterone.

This is problematic because we know T levels decline around 1% per year starting around age 35, yet this range applies to men who are 20 as well as 70.

## The Solution

In order to have an accurate understanding of what "healthy T levels are", it should be benchmarked first and foremost by age, so that you know what percentile T you have for other people of your age.

The t.db will be the largest open-source data set on testosterone. We hope to also have other variables so that we can look at BMI vs T, political orientation vs T, income and T, sexuality and T, etc. These are more fun and less practical but the purpose again is to raise awareness about declining T levels.

## License

Technically, the BSL is not "open-source" as defined by open-source purists. The main purpose for using this license is to create an accessible data set for consumers and patients. The BSL is used defensively so that billion dollar pharma companies, EHRs, testing labs, etc. do not use this data set for their own commercial purposes. They could open-source their own data sets on testosterone lvels, as well as other health data, which could be used for disease diagnosis, detection, and treatment, but instead they keep the data for themselves.
