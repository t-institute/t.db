## The Problem

[Testosterone levels have declined 30% in the last 40 years](https://www.tparty.org/p/announcing-t-party). Furthermore, sperm count levels have declined 60% in the last 40 years, and women are also going through puberty 2 years earlier than 40 years before. There is no definitive consensus yet on what is driving these trends, but it is likely some combination of lifestyle and [environmental toxins](https://twitter.com/inflammateomnia/status/1685864874155429888).

One systematic issue with the American healthcare system is that there is one monolithic range for "healthy testosterone levels", typically said to be 300-1000 ng/dL total testosterone.

This is problematic because we know T levels decline around 1% per year starting around age 35, yet healthcare institutions use the same range for men who are 20 as well as 70.

## The Solution

In order to have an accurate understanding of what "healthy T levels are", we first and foremost needs T levels benchmarked with age, so that you know what percentile T you have for other people of your age.

The t.db will be the largest open-source data set on testosterone. We hope to also have other variables, e.g. BMI, political orientation, income, sexuality, etc. This would let us pose spicy questions like:

- Who has higher testosterone, liberals or conservatives?
- Who has higher testosterone, straights, gays, or bisexuals?
- Who has higher testosterone, Golden State Warrior fans or Bulls fans?
- Who has higher testosterone, Founders or VCs or engineers?

These are more fun and less practical but the purpose again is to raise awareness about declining T levels so that the everyday person is aware of these issues.

## License

Technically, the BSL is not "open-source" as defined by open-source purists. The main purpose for using this license is to create an accessible data set for consumers and patients. The BSL is used defensively so that billion dollar pharma, EHRs, testing lab companies, etc. do not use this data set for their own commercial purposes. They could open-source their own data sets on testosterone levels, as well as other health data, which could be used for advanced disease diagnosis, detection, and treatment, but instead they keep the data for themselves.

## t.institute

The long-term vision for t.institute is to become the de facto source of information for testosterone. We will start with t.db, the largest open-source database on testosterone. Then, we will publish research on testosterone, addressing questions like those posed in [The Solution](#the-solution), to garner mainstream attention. Finally, with this credibility, we hope to shape public policy, such as regulating water, agriculture, and cosmetic companies to ensure they are testing for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, so we are at least aware of how many toxins we are ingesting through using their products.

## T Party

This project is owned and maintained by [tparty.org](https://www.tparty.org/), a men's health company. T Party publishes a science and evidence-backed newsletter every Tuesday, and hosts testosterone testing parties, i.e. "T Parties".
